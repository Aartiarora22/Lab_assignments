## Problem Statement
Given x and y as input. Print all the powers of x from 1 to y i.e. x1x2x3x4... xn.

**Sample Test Case**
```
Input:
x = 13, y = 2

Output:
13#169#
```
## Other Test cases

**Test Case 1**
```
Input:
x = 17, y = 3

Output:
17#289#4913
```


## How to attempt?
For the given task the solution is already provided. Refer the steps below to execute your second code.

For the given problem the system will provide user inputs directly. You don't need to write any code to take user input.

### Steps to Run your second code
1. Copy the source code from [Source Code Link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aartiarora22/Lab_assignments/main/P4/T6/main.java)
2. Paste in the editor window on the right
3. Refer the solution code given below and make necessary changes to your code
4. Hit **Submit** button
5. If you followed the steps then your code will pass test cases

## Solution / Hint
1. Make a new string to create a pattern.
2. Inside for loop use the value of x, apply accumulator pattern to get calculation in the output pattern.
3. Apply accumulator pattern on final string and combine the calculation with "#" pattern for each value of loop.
